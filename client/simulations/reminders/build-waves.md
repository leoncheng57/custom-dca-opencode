title: A long migration made durable before wave one
trigger: build-waves
caveat: >-
  Only setup and one wave boundary are shown. A real sustained build continues
  for hours and may compact or change models before final verification.

# Worked example

## user

migrate reporting off the legacy schema

*Reminder attached: Build in Verified Waves*

## tool — shell interpolation

```
background subagents: available
```

## assistant

I wrote `docs/reporting-migration-plan.md` and mirrored it in `todowrite`:

```
wave 0  baseline + schema map       done
wave 1  query layer                 active
wave 2  renderers                   queued
wave 3  API routes                  queued
wave 4  client                      queued
wave 5  final verification          queued
```

Wave 5 exists before implementation starts. Each wave owns disjoint files;
shared migrations and the lockfile remain parent-owned.

While I implement wave 1, one read-only background agent is mapping wave 2's
renderer callers. I will reconcile that report at the boundary, verify wave 1,
update both durable records, and continue without asking permission.

## tool — task

```
explore, background=true
scope: server/reports/ callers only
forbidden: server/queries/ (parent is editing it)
```

## note

The command did not begin by editing. The plan file, queue, ownership boundaries,
and final verification wave are the restart protocol if context compacts.

The shell interpolation made background availability a fact rather than an
assumption; an unavailable flag would produce a sequential run instead of a fake
parallel one.
