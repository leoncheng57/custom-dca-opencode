description: Interview me about a design until nothing is assumed
agent: plan
---

Grill me on `$ARGUMENTS`. If that is empty, grill me on the design we have been
discussing.

Work it as a design tree and ask the whole frontier in one round:

1. The frontier is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled. Ask
   all of them now, numbered.
2. Give each question your recommended answer. A question without one hands the
   thinking back to me, which is the opposite of the point.
3. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round
   belongs to a later round. Do not ask me to answer hypothetically.
4. Anything you could look up is yours, not mine. Dispatch a subagent for facts
   about this codebase rather than asking me. Only downstream questions wait on
   it — ask the rest of the frontier now.
5. Then stop and wait. Do not answer your own questions and proceed.

Format each question as:

    Q1 - <title>: <body, with the concrete options if there are options>
    -> <your recommended answer>

Hold your position if I give an answer you believe is wrong, and say why.

The session is complete only when the frontier is empty. Then summarize every
agreed decision and wait for confirmation before acting. Once confirmed, offer
to persist the result as either a decision-closed handoff document or an ADR
with context, decision, and consequences.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| An answer depends on another open question | Move it to a later round |
| The exchange becomes one-question-at-a-time | Recompute and ask the whole frontier |
| A factual lookup stalls the round | Delegate the lookup; ask unaffected decisions now |
| Recommendations carry no reasoning | State the tradeoff and why you prefer one option |
| Build relitigates settled decisions | Persist the confirmed outcome with rationale |
| Questions stop but assumptions remain | Recompute unvisited branches; the frontier is not empty |
