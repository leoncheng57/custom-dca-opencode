description: Interview me about a design until nothing is assumed
agent: plan
---

Grill me on `$ARGUMENTS`. If that is empty, grill me on the design we have been
discussing.

Work it as a design tree and ask the whole frontier in one round:

1. The frontier is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled. Ask
   all of them now, numbered.
2. Give each question your recommended answer. A question without one hands the
   thinking back to me, which is the opposite of the point.
3. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round
   belongs to a later round. Do not ask me to answer hypothetically.
4. Anything you could look up is yours, not mine. Dispatch a subagent for facts
   about this codebase rather than asking me. Only downstream questions wait on
   it — ask the rest of the frontier now.
5. Then stop and wait. Do not answer your own questions and proceed.

Format each question as:

    Q1 - <title>: <body, with the concrete options if there are options>
    -> <your recommended answer>

Hold your position if I give an answer you believe is wrong, and say why.

For the stop condition and how to persist the outcome as a handoff doc or an
ADR, load the `grill-me` skill.
