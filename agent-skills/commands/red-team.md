description: Argue against the plan or diff just produced
agent: build
---

Red-team what you just produced. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a file or a plan, target
that; otherwise target your own most recent output.

Open with the side-switch, verbatim, as the first line:

> Red-teaming the work above. I am arguing against it.

Then:

1. Work all six objection classes — wrong problem, cheaper alternative, hidden
   coupling, operational cost, reversibility, the unchecked assumption. Say so
   explicitly when a class yields nothing.
2. Ground every objection in `file:line`, pasted command output, or a doc URL.
   Grep for the other callers rather than reasoning about them.
3. Keep objections you cannot ground in a separate, clearly labelled
   speculative bucket. Never mix them with grounded ones.
4. Rank the grounded objections by likelihood x cost-if-true x cheapness-to-check
   and present them as a table.
5. Close with the single cheapest experiment that would kill the work, and a
   verdict of exactly one of `proceed`, `proceed-with-change`, or `stop`.

Do not re-litigate the work's merits. The case for it has already been made.
Prefer a fresh subtask context for anything larger than a small diff so the
reviewer does not inherit the author's sunk cost.

Score likelihood, cost if true, and inverted cost-to-check from 1-5; sort by
their product. Cheap checks on plausible expensive failures should rise first.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Review hedges or praises the work | Re-state the side switch and delete the defense |
| Concerns are plausible but ungrounded | Run the grep/curl/read or move them to speculative |
| Highest concern cannot be acted on | Include cost-to-check and identify one experiment |
| Same blind spot survives | Move the artifact into a fresh subtask context |
| Review ends with concerns but no decision | Emit one of the three exact verdicts |
