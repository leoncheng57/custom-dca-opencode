description: Compile a self-contained handoff prompt for a fresh session
agent: build
subtask: true
---

Write a handoff prompt that a fresh agent — one with zero knowledge of this
conversation — can execute for: $ARGUMENTS

Current repository state:

!`git rev-parse --show-toplevel && git branch --show-current && git status --short`

The prompt must be decision-closed and re-derivation-proof. Include, in order:

1. Absolute worktree path, branch, and the base revision it was cut from.
2. Whether dependencies are installed and whether the baseline is green, with
   the passing test count.
3. `PRE-RESEARCHED - DO NOT RE-DERIVE:` — every finding carrying `file:line`,
   including the negative ones. "No dialog primitive exists anywhere, you are
   building the first one" is as expensive to establish as any positive finding
   and is the thing agents most often get wrong.
4. Decisions already taken, each with its rationale, so the agent does not
   relitigate them.
5. `GOTCHA:` lines for anything that will silently no-op.
6. Numbered build steps, each naming the file to create and an existing file to
   model it on.
7. Out of scope, with a reason per exclusion, phrased as "list as follow-ups in
   the PR body, do not build".
8. Exact verification commands and any runner limitation.
9. `SHARED-RESOURCE RULE:` naming every sibling worktree, its branch, and the
   fixed ports or state directories only one of them may hold at a time.
10. The report-back contract and the stop condition.

Plain ASCII only — no smart quotes and no box-drawing. The text will pass
through a shell and a terminal emulator on its way to the agent.

Write it to a file outside every git working tree and print the path. Do not
launch anything; show me the prompt first.

For the research phase that feeds this, load `parallel-research-handoff`. For
launching the session afterwards, load `session-handoff`.
