agent: plan

For `$ARGUMENTS`, read the relevant source first and write the result with the
smallest useful repository-relative `path:line` citation after every material
claim. Distinguish verified facts from inference and do not invent locations.

Prefer the definition, behavior branch, request boundary, assertion, or call
site that proves the statement over a nearby comment or suggestive filename.
Use one citation when it proves the claim; add another only when the behavior
crosses a boundary. Put evidence immediately after the claim.

For a review, cite both the changed line causing the risk and the surrounding
contract when they differ. For a diagnosis, cite the reachable failure path and
the condition that reaches it. Pin external review links to the reviewed commit
SHA so they cannot drift.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Exact location is unknown | Search for it or mark the claim unverified |
| Citation points only to a comment or caller | Read through and cite the load-bearing implementation |
| References obscure the argument | Keep the smallest set that establishes the point |
| Fact and inference are mixed | Label the inference separately |
