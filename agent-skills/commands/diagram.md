description: Draw an annotated ASCII diagram instead of a prose wall
agent: plan
---

Draw an ASCII diagram for `$ARGUMENTS`. If that is empty, diagram the plan,
change set, flow, or UI we are currently discussing.

Choose exactly one form:

- **Annotated file tree** for "what files change" — path, NEW/MOD/DEL status,
  then a comment only when it adds a design or coordination fact.
- **Vertical data flow** for "how does X reach Y" — boxes only for components,
  branches off the trunk, and failure modes attached where they bite.
- **UI mockup** for "what will it look like" — real copy, consistent widths,
  and the delta marked once with `NEW`.

Hard requirements:

1. Fence the diagram so a proportional font cannot destroy it.
2. Keep every line at or below 100 characters.
3. Align status columns and box edges across the whole diagram.
4. Put traps inline with `<-`; do not hide them in prose underneath.
5. Use realistic labels and counts, never lorem or placeholders.
6. Every annotation must say something the structure cannot already show.

Return the diagram first, then no more than five bullets explaining the
load-bearing choices. Do not use Mermaid unless the user explicitly asked for
a rendered diagram.

Use one consistent character set. Box drawing is reliable in normal monospace
renderers; ambiguous-width emoji can shift terminal columns, so use ASCII
markers for terminals known to render them double-width. Count characters, not
UTF-8 bytes, and inspect the result in a monospace surface before publishing.

Do not diagram a single-file change, yes/no answer, two-axis comparison, or a
linear sequence with no branches. Use prose, a table, or a numbered list.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Columns or box edges drift | Recount character widths and use one shared offset |
| Diagram shows only a happy path | Attach the failure at the arrow where it occurs |
| An annotation repeats the structure | Delete it or replace it with a design or coordination fact |
| Mermaid appears unrendered | Fall back to fenced ASCII unless the target surface is proven to render it |

Longer annotated examples live in `agent-skills/command-docs/diagram-examples.md`.
