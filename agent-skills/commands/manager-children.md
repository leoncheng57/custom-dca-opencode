description: Dispatch isolated OpenCode workers and manage their PR wave
agent: build
---

Manage `$ARGUMENTS` through separate OpenCode workers in sibling git worktrees
and unfocused CMUX workspaces.

Before dispatch:

1. Write a durable wave plan with ownership, dependencies, integration order,
   and final verification.
2. State explicitly that standalone children continue after this turn but do
   not automatically resume the manager.
3. Create one worktree and branch per disjoint assignment from the current
   remote default branch.
4. Require status files, heartbeats, verified commits, pushed branches, and PRs.

Standalone children cannot resume this manager by writing status, pushing a PR,
changing a badge, or running `cmux notify`. Those are durable evidence or human
alerts, not an OpenCode callback. The manager resumes only on a user message, an
in-process task result, or a separately tested supervisor prompt. Never promise
unattended progression without that wake channel.

Cut waves on complete artifacts and disjoint files. Parallel workers may read
shared files but must not edit the same integration file, lockfile, migration,
generated output, port, or database. Cap a wave around five children. Create
each sibling worktree after fetching the remote default branch, verify its path,
branch, clean status, dependencies, baseline, and fixed-port ownership.

Every cold-start assignment must name the absolute worktree and branch,
objective, owned and forbidden files, sibling workers, settled contracts,
non-goals, permission posture, model, exact tests, definition of done, and the
rule that children never push the default branch. Require a gitignored
`.agent-status.json` with phases `assigned`, `working`, `verifying`, `pushed`,
`pr-open`, `blocked`, and `done`; UTC timestamps come from `date -u`, update on
every transition, and heartbeat at least every ten minutes.

Monitor in this order: status file, Git/remote/PR/CI evidence, then the child
screen only when evidence is stale or contradictory. A stale heartbeat or a
`done` badge without a pushed branch is not delivery proof.

On every resumed turn, read the durable plan and status files, fetch remotes,
inspect exact-head checks, reconcile ownership, then continue the queued action.
If nothing is ready, report that and stop rather than busy-waiting. Integrate one
reviewed branch at a time, run the full suite after each merge, and clean a
worktree only after merge and after confirming no follow-up needs it.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Manager stops after dispatch | Wait for a real inbound turn; restore durable state |
| Notification produces no manager action | Correct the claim: it notified a human only |
| Two children edit one seam | Stop one writer and sequence ownership |
| Tracker says done but no PR exists | Inspect Git and require push/PR evidence |
| Child works in the wrong checkout | Stop and relaunch with absolute containment |
| Automated wake duplicates turns | Disable it until idle checks, dedupe, and serialization are proven |
| Manager loses the next action | Restore the synchronized plan and task queue |
