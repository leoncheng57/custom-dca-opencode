agent: build

Research and prepare handoffs for: `$ARGUMENTS`

Three phases, in order:

1. **Read-only research.** Split the supplied tasks into independent axes and
   launch one read-only agent per task concurrently. Require structure, prior
   art, the nearest analogue, concrete integration points, live API truth when
   reachable by GET, testing conventions, explicit gaps, `file:line` evidence,
   and a final `UNVERIFIED:` list.
2. **Compile prompts.** Turn each report into a decision-closed prompt containing
   the absolute worktree/branch state, docs to read first,
   `PRE-RESEARCHED - DO NOT RE-DERIVE`, settled decisions with rationale,
   `GOTCHA:` lines, numbered build steps, reasoned exclusions, constraints,
   exact verification, `SHARED-RESOURCE RULE`, and the report-back contract.
   Store prompt files outside every git worktree.
3. **Stop for review.** Show every prompt before launching. Ask whether the
   receiving sessions should plan first or edit immediately, and whether they
   should open PRs or leave local commits. Do not fire anything until those two
   choices are answered.

Use plain ASCII in prompt files, and do not recreate a baseline from a stale
local default branch. Research axes must be independent, read-only, and large
enough to justify delegation; a needle lookup stays inline. State READ-ONLY at
both ends of each prompt. Restrict live API probes to GET and preserve verbatim
response shapes.

For later launch, fetch first, create sibling worktrees from the remote default
branch, install dependencies in each, and prove a baseline before allowing
edits. Enumerate fixed ports, writable state, databases, generated output, and
lockfiles in every receiving prompt. Only one worker may own a shared resource.
Never steal focus when creating a session.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Research agent starts implementing | Stop it and strengthen the read-only boundary |
| Receiving agent re-greps everything | Add `file:line` evidence and explicit negative findings |
| Scope is relitigated | Preserve the decision's rationale and evidence |
| Both workers bind one port or state directory | Keep stack-free checks parallel; serialize the shared stack |
| First test is red | Establish whether baseline or worker caused it before proceeding |
| Prompt is mangled | Store plain-ASCII text in a file; do not inline multiline shell arguments |
| Live feature silently no-ops | Probe its actual gate or API before writing the handoff |
