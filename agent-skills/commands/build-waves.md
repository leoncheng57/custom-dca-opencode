description: Run a long implementation as durable waves through verification
agent: build
---

Build `$ARGUMENTS` to completion as one sustained multi-wave run.

Background-subagent availability:

!`test "${OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS:-}" = true && echo available || echo unavailable`

Before implementation:

1. Write a plan file containing scope, settled decisions, wave order, file
   ownership, dependencies, shared-resource constraints, and exact verification
   commands. The queue must survive compaction and a model change.
2. Put every wave in `todowrite`, including the final verification wave. Mark
   only one implementation wave active.
3. Establish the repository's baseline when practical and record its test count.
4. Cut waves on disjoint files and produced artifacts, not vague feature areas.
   Tasks that touch one lockfile, port, database, or generated artifact are
   sequential, not parallel.

During the run:

- The parent owns all coherent writes and cross-wave design by default.
- While implementing wave N, background read-only research for wave N+1 when
  the flag above is available. If it is unavailable, continue sequentially;
  never pretend foreground work is background work.
- At each boundary, verify the completed wave, reconcile returned research,
  update both the plan file and `todowrite`, and immediately begin the next wave.
- Do not ask "shall I continue?" after a progress report.
- If verification fails, add and execute a bounded fix wave, then rerun the
  affected checks and the final suite.

Stop only for a real product/scope/safety decision, an unassessed verification
failure, or every wave including final verification being green.

Keep fan-out flat and capped around five tasks. Prefer read-only children while
the parent owns coherent writes. Every task must name owned files, forbidden
files and shared resources, its input, its output, and its acceptance check.

Persist load-bearing findings and the next-wave brief in the plan file; chat is
not durable across compaction. A standalone CMUX child cannot wake this parent
by writing status or notifying the human, so never promise unattended progress
without a tested, serialized supervisor.

Afterward, use child session records only as provenance and cost evidence, not
as a substitute for the planned final verification.

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Children repeat research | Tighten artifact and directory boundaries |
| Two tasks touch a lockfile, port, database, or generated output | Sequence them or give integration to the parent |
| Context compacts or the model changes | Restore the plan file and synchronized task list |
| Final checks fail | Add a bounded fix wave, then rerun affected and aggregate checks |
| A standalone child finishes | Resume only on a real inbound turn; status and CMUX alerts are not callbacks |
